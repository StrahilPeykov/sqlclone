When joining tables, some rows may not have matching counterparts.

- Inner join: include only rows with matches in both tables.
- Outer join: include rows without matches, filling missing columns with NULLs. Variants include left, right, and full outer joins.

Choosing between inner and outer joins controls whether unmatched rows are excluded or preserved with NULLs.
