To work reliably with rows, a table needs a way to uniquely identify each row. These identifiers are known as keys.

- Super keys: any set of columns that uniquely identify a row (assuming no duplicates).
- Candidate keys: minimal super keys (no column is redundant).
- Primary key: the chosen candidate key used in practice to identify rows.

Foreign keys are columns that reference a primary key in another table, creating relationships between tables.
