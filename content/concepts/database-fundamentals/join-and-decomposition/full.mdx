When a table contains duplicated data, it can be better to split it into multiple tables and relate them with keys.

- Decomposition: split a table into two (or more) related tables, typically linked by a foreign key.
- Join: combine related tables back together on their key relationships.

Well-designed decompositions should be lossless: joining the decomposed tables should reconstruct the original data without loss.
