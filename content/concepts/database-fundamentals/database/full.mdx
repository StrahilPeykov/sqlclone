Suppose you have a list of all tech companies in the world, with many properties for each. How would you store this data? For small cases a single file might work, but at scale we need databases.

## Why databases? A list of requirements
- Deal with large amounts of data efficiently.
- Ask questions easily (queries), like “How many data science companies are in the Netherlands?”
- Support concurrent updates from applications and users.

To meet these requirements, databases and corresponding tools exist.

## Database: a collection of tables
A database stores data, typically in table form. You can think of it as a collection of tables filled with potentially large amounts of entries. Small databases have a few small tables; larger ones can have dozens of huge, interconnected tables.

> Note: Some databases deviate from pure tables and store objects (MongoDB), graphs (Neo4j), or key‑value pairs (Redis). Here we focus on table‑based databases.

## The database management system (DBMS)
The database is the data. The software that stores, manages, and serves that data is the Database Management System (DBMS). Examples include PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite. A DBMS can host multiple databases on the same machine, but a database is tied to its DBMS.

> Tip: People often say “database” when they mean the DBMS. For example: “We use SQLite” refers to the DBMS; the database is the data managed by it.
