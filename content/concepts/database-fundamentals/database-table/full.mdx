When a database consists of tables (a relational database), its terms align with relational theory:

- A table is a relation.
- Columns are attributes (fields).
- Rows are tuples (records).
- Individual items are cells (fields).

The design of a database is the schema; the actual stored data is the instance. Tables organize data in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet, and the schema defines each tableâ€™s structure.
