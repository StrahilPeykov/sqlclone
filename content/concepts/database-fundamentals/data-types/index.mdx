In relational databases, columns have specific data types that define what kind of values they can store.

Common types include numbers, text, and dates. Data types are defined per column and influence how values are stored, compared, and processed.

SQL also has a special NULL value which represents “no value” or “unknown”. NULL behaves differently from regular values in comparisons and aggregations.
