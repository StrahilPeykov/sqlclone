A database can hold large amounts of data that help answer complex questions. To work with it, you send a query to the database management system (DBMS).

## Queries: commands for the DBMS
A query is a request/command for the DBMS, such as:
- Find all Tech Companies from "The Netherlands".
- Count the number of Tech Companies per country.
- Update the country for a specific company.

Queries can read data (read queries) or modify data (write queries), including create, update, and delete operations.

## Query language: how to write queries
DBMSs don’t understand natural language; they need commands in a specific format called a query language. Most table‑based databases adopt the SQL standard, so many queries look like small pieces of code:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TechCompanies
WHERE country = "The Netherlands";
```

Because SQL is widely adopted, it’s the most commonly used query language for databases.
