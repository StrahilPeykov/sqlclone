SQL is the world’s most widely used database query language. Its syntax reads somewhat like structured text, making many queries approachable.

## A basic query
The simplest SQL query selects all columns from a table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TechCompanies;
```

The asterisk (*) means “all columns”. This query is commonly used to explore full tables.

## Properties of queries
SQL is flexible in formatting: extra whitespace has no effect and is often used to improve readability. Core keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, …) are case‑insensitive, though they’re usually capitalized by convention. Table and column casing may be DBMS‑specific. Queries are often terminated with a semicolon.

## History of SQL
SQL originated at IBM in the 1970s (from SQUARE to SEQUEL to SQL). In 1986, ANSI and ISO standardized the “Database Language SQL”. The standard evolves over time; most DBMSs largely follow it, though dialect differences remain. The result is a mature, feature‑rich language with many ways to achieve the same result.
