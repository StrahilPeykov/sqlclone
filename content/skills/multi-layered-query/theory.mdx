Use subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to build layered logic.

Subquery example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM positions
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM positions);
```

CTE example:

```sql
WITH high_salary AS (
  SELECT * FROM positions WHERE salary > 120000
)
SELECT * FROM high_salary ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
